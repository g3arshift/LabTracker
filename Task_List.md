## General Idea
* An application that allows you to track the inventory of a homelab. This includes both physical inventory, and digital for things like VM's.
* Key features: FLEXIBLE, BUT ALSO EASY TO USE AND DEPLOY. GOAL IS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND TO MOBILE APP, BUT ALSO JUST SIMPLY RUN AND DEPLOY AS STANDALONE OR IN DOCKER/PODMAN. MOBILE APP TARGET IS LATER. JUST LEAVE FRAMEWORK EXPANDABLE. Set it up so multi-user 
	* Allows you to create whitebox builds using inventory
	* If item added to whitebox is not in inventory, allow in menu item creation
	* Allow user created object types
	* Note section for inventory items, but especially systems
	* Web application. The Java code runs as the backend with an embedded DB, and you access it through a browser. It also has an API for possible future mobile releases that simply contact back to a hosted app.
* Expected use case: Tracking items. By default setup for a single user, but more users can be added
	*Requires login, but not simultaneous session or multi-user tracking
* Misc Notes:
	* Inventory items have both a picture associated with them as an type of object and a specific object, as well as a gallery for the specific object
	* Read all object types from the DB, including default object types
		* Create super object type for the DB items so we can handle reading everything from DB
	* Use H2DB http://www.h2database.com/html/cheatSheet.html
* Scan the source code with a vulnerability chcker https://mergebase.com/blog/java-scanning/
* Salt and hash passwords in DB
* Create a graph to view and compare data on inventory items based on BuyPrice and SellPrice
* Add support for parsing PCPartPicker links into valid builds
* Use Hibernate
* App demo on website
* Installer and uninstaller

## Tasks

###Part 0: Setup and Planning

* [ ] Create database schema diagram
	* [ ] Create a database schema
	* [ ] Only do soft deletes. When a user deletes an item, mark it for deletion, which will then be properly deleted in 30 days. Perform this action when the application is booted.
	* Mark what user made the change to an item, and when
	* Mark which user created an item, and when
	* [ ] Populate a test database with test data
	* [ ] On Start have it prompt user for a username and password if it doesn't exist, then create the DB with those
	* [ ] Timestamp updating has to happen IN CODE. H2 doesn't support it
* [ ] Salt and hash password with bcrypt https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-registration-password-encoding-bcrypt
